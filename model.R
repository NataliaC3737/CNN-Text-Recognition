In this module, I will define the architecture of the CNN. 
There'll be some functions to build different parts of the network, such as 
convolutional layers, pooling layers, fully connected layers, etc. 
Also It will include functions to compile the model and configure the 
training process, such as choosing the loss function and optimizer.
